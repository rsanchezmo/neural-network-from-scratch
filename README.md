# MATLAB Neural Network from scratch
This neural network implementation in MATLAB does not require any additional toolbox. You can change the number of layers and its size. The net is trained and displays the cost and the precission during its learning process. The net has implemented the regularization terms. 

## Notes
The dataset is obtained from the Machine Learning Course on Coursera which is given by Andrew Ng. The dataset consists on numbers and the net learns to identify them. The precision is on the training set, so to verify the precision on the test set, should get one and call predict function on that dataset.
